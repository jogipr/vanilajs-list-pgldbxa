# vanilajs-list-pgldbxa

here is the exmaple of displaying List in vanila js.

To show the new item in the list we have to tear down the entire list and re-create the list again

As we know the DOM manipulation is expensive .this problem is very well handle by react using virtual concept.

We can also manage to add the content at last but we will have add the extra logic

this project contains the example of Dedicated Worker which run in separate thread
